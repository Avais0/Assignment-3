    <h1>Exploring the World of Literature </h1>
    <p>Classic novels have had a profound and lasting impact on literature, shaping not only the development of
        narrative forms but also the way in which society views itself. Works like Don Quixote <strong>Moby-Dick
            Pride and Prejudice</strong>, and <strong> Crime and Punishment <strong> have become cornerstones of
                literary tradition, offering timeless themes of identity, morality, and the complexities of human
                nature. These novels have influenced generations of writers, providing models of structure, character
                development, and language that continue to resonate today. <em>Through their exploration of universal
                    themes—love, ambition, injustice, and the search for meaning—classic novels have helped to define
                    the boundaries of literature, setting standards for artistic achievement and offering readers a
                    deep, often transformative engagement with the world.</em> Their continued relevance in modern
                culture underscores the enduring power of great storytelling to transcend time and place.</p>

    refuge from the mundane and a glimpse into the extraordinary. The act of reading is not just about absorbing
